## What is Python ? 

-  Python is an interpreted programming language
- It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991

## Execution Order 

- In programming , code is generally executed line-by-line from top to bottom and this holds true for python code as well

## Printing Text

- using a backslash `\` aka the escape charcter before each quote character inside a string tells the python interpreter we want to interpret the quote `"` as a charcter inside the string , not as a quote that ends the string

  ```python
  print("They said, \"Hello, world!\"")
  ```

## Code Error

- syntax error
  - Occurs when the code is not written correctly according to the rules of the programming language

## Comments

- In python comments are created using the # character , any text after the # character on a line is considered a comment

  ```python
  # This is a comment
  ```
