# Math

## Arithmetic Operators

- Addition `+`: Adds two operands together.
- Subtraction `-`: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- Multiplication `*`: Multiplies two operands.
- Division `/`: Divides the first operand by the second. The result is *always* a float.

- If we divide `y` by `x`, the result will be `2.0` and *not* `2`. This is because the result of division is always a float in Python.
- For the other arithmetic operators, the result will be an integer if both operands are integers. If one of the operands is a float, the result will be a float.

## More Operators 

- Floor Division `//`: Divides the first operand by the second and rounds down the result to an integer.
- Modulus `%`: Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.
- Exponentiation `**`: Raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

## Shorthand Operators 

- `-=` is shorthand for `count = count -`
- `*=` is shorthand for `count = count *`
- `/=` is shorthand for `count = count /`
- `%=` is shorthand for `count = count %`
- `//=` is shorthand for `count = count //`
- `**=` is shorthand for `count = count **`

## Boolean OR 

- the keyword  `or`  is used to perform a **logical OR operation**.

## Boolean AND

- the keyword  `and`  is used to perform a **logical AND operation**.

## Boolean Negation

- the keyword  `not`  is used to perform a **logical NOT operation** also known as negation.
