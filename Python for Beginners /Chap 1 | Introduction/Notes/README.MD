# Introduction

## Hello World

- To print `Hello world!` we use the following syntax 

  ```python
  print("Hello, world!")
  ```

## What is Python ? 

- Python is an interpreted programming language 

## Execution Order

- In programming, code is generally executed line-by-line, from top to bottom, and this holds true for Python code as well

## Printing Text

- A string is just a sequence of characters between the opening and closing quotes 

- If we wanted to print a string that also contains quote characters we can use a backslash `\` aka the escape character

  ```python
  print("They said, \"Hello, world!\"")
  ```

## Code Errors

- Syntax Error
  - Syntax errors occur when the code is not written correctly according to the rules of the programming language
- Runtime Error
  - A runtime error is an error that occurs while the program is running. That means the syntax of the program itself is fine. It is usually caused by something that the programmer did not anticipate
- Logical Error
  - A logical error is an error that occurs when the program runs without crashing or producing an error, but the output is not what the programmer intended. This is commonly known as a bug

## Comments

- Comments are created using the `#` character. Any text after the `#` character on a line is considered a comment.

  ```python
  # This is a comment
  ```
