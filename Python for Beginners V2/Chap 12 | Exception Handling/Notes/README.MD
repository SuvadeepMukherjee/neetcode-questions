# Exception Handling 

## Try Except

- When an error occurs in a program, it usually causes the program to crash.

- But there is a way we can handle these errors and prevent the program from crashing. This is done using the `try` and `except` blocks.

- A `try` block is reminiscent to an `if-else` statement. The code inside a `try` block is always executed, but if any line of code raises an error, the program will immediately jump to the `except` block. If no error occurs, the `except` block is skipped.

  ```python
  try:
      # code that might cause an error
      result = 10 / 0
  except:
      print("An error occurred!")
  
  print("This will be printed regardless.")
  ```

## Error Catching

- When an error occurs in a `try` block, it may be useful for us to know exactly what error occurred. This can allow us to better debug our code.

  ```python
  try:
      result = 10 / 0
  except Exception as error:
      print("Error:", error)
  ```

- The above code will *catch* the error and place it inside a variable called `error` using the `as` keyword. We can then print this variable to see the error message, which would be:

  ```python
  Error: division by zero
  ```

  

## Multiple Except Blocks

- Instead of having a single `except` block to handle all exceptions,

  ```python
  try:
      n = 10 / 0
  except Exception as error:
      print("An error occurred:", error)
  ```

- you can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

- ```python
  try:
      num1 = int(a)
      num2 = int(b)
      result = num1 / num2
  except ValueError:
      print("Error: Invalid value!")
  except ZeroDivisionError:
      print("Error: Division by zero!")    
  except Exception as error:
      print("An error occurred:", error)
  ```

- In the first example we catch all exceptions with `Exception`. In the second example, we have different blocks to handle different exceptions. The first `except` will catch a `ValueError`, the second will catch a `ZeroDivisionError`, and the third will catch any other exceptions. That means, if neither a `ValueError` nor a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, the third block will still catch all other exceptions.
